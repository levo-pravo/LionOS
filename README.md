# LionOS
Emulator for LionOS

## Okay what is it
- BIOS x86_16 (real mode at least now)
- QEMU make this poop be alive
- Loading from floppy
- It says "hai wold"
- It says "... LionOS"
- It reads character from keyboard and puts character on screen
- It reads 1 line BUT!! For magical, ubelievable reasons Enter doesn't work - QEMU is bad. So for a small "x" it reads 1 line. Yeah...
